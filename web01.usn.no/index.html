          <p>The fourth industrial revolution has created endless possibilities for companies to monitor and control their process units effectively from easily accessible web application. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the development of a cloud-based monitoring web application for an air heater process unit in addition to conduct analysis of the control unit.</p>
          <p>Development of the cloud-based monitoring application linked with a control system and a database system is described in this paper. Where the objectives for the control system is to create a simulated discrete air heater model based on mathematical equations in addition to creating a sufficiently tuned PI controller. The pre-development phase of the simulator includes frequency response and stability analysis.</p>
          <p>The use of Mqtt communication protocol in combination with the control system is used to publish relevant measurement data from the control system to external clients. The client PC subscribing to the data is further used for storage of data inside a cloud-based SQL database provided by Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. An Azure web application developed in Visual Studio is additionally implemented to sufficiently create a process monitoring application in cooperation with the database. Despite having endless revolutionizing possibilities of IoT solution, there are certain cyber security concerns. These concerns are mentioned and described in the security section of the paper.</p>

          <p>A python program is developed to simulate the behavior of a real air heater unit based on mathematical models shown in eq 2.0-2.4. Where the process simulator is controlled by a discrete PI controller for the outlet temperature from the unit and a lowpass filter is implemented for filtering out measurement noise. The PI controller is based on the difference between reference values and measurement values to calculate error. It utilizes the integral and proportional terms of the PID controller with the possibilities of tuning Kp (gain) and Ti (integral time) parameters.<a href="refpage.html#ref_list">[2]</a> Equations 2.1 and 2.3 are discretized based on eq 2.0 and 2.2 by using forward Euler, as shown below.</p>

          <p>Fast and stable control systems are highly desirable for process units to quickly respond to its task without causing any unstability. Finding the perfect balance between responsiveness and stability is one of the main challenges before deployment of a control system. Where quick response time could cause instabilities while slow response time could improve the stability of the control system.</p>

          <p>The stability analysis run with the process parameters and initial controller parameters defined in <a href="controller_parameter.JPG">Figure 2.1.2</a> earlier in the methodology section. These PI controller parameters are based on the Zieglar-Nichols method. The step response of the controller is shown below in the in <a href=" step_response1.jpg ">Figure 3.1.1</a>. Where the response is fairly quick, but has some initial oscillation with more stabilized values over time for tracking of the setpoint.

          <p>To further improve the tuning of the controller parameters, the controller gain is decreased to minimize the oscillation by setting Kp=0.8 and increasing Ti to 18s. The results of the improved PI-controller are shown below in <a href=" step_response2.jpg ">Figure 3.1.2</a>. Where the overshoot is decreased, while the response time is increased.

The intersection between the magnitude curve and the zero dB line in the upper plot is defined as wc (Crossover Point rad/s) which indicates to the PM (Phase Margin) in degrees from the lower plot. While the intersection between the phase curve and the -180deg line in the lower plot is defined as w180 (Crossover point rad/s) for the phase plot. W180 indicates to the GM (Gain Margin) without decibel. Since the GM and PM values are positive, it indicates to a stable system. The Kc (Critical gain) value is calculated by multiplying the used Kp value with the GM value without decibel. Kc value is 4.89 which indicates how much the Kp value can be increased before creating an unstable system. All of these values are calculated and illustrated besides the plot in <a href="bodeplot.JPG">Figure 3.1.3</a>.</p>

          <h1 class="text-left" id="security">4. Security</h1>
          <p>Cyber security is a very important subject when it comes to IoT solution. One of the biggest challenges is to combat potential attacks or deny access to information gained by unauthorized personnel. Cyber security has been taken account to in all facets of this application.</p>
          <p>Firstly, in the communication protocol MQTT where the security is divided into multiple layers for prevention of different types of attacks. The network layer provides trustworthy connection by using physically secure network for communication between clients and the broker. The transport level deals with confidentiality where TLS/SSL is used for encryption of transported data. This secures the transmission from unauthorized access. Application layer is the last layer, where communication is encrypted, and authentication is required from identities. Username and password credentials are required to authenticate the devices on the application level.<a href="refpage.html#ref_list">[4]</a></p>
          <p>SQL injection is a code injection technique that can cause harm to databases by destroying the database or expose crucial information such as passwords. Certain combative actions have been taken into account under development of the database and under the connection protocol to the database. Users have been created additionally to the default sa user, proper data types have been implemented for the web application and the connection string to the database is not hard coded.<a href="refpage.html#ref_list">[5]</a> </p>
          <p>SQL servers require SQL authentication which refers to the authentication of a user when connecting to SQL databases. A server admin login with a username and password must be specified when the server is being created. Using these credentials, a server admin can authenticate to any database on that server or instance as the database owner. Additional SQL logins and users can be created by the server admin, which enable users to connect using their username and password as illustrated in <a href="authentication.jpg">Figure 4.1</a>. </p>

          </div>
          <p>The Azure SQL server operates similarly but it has IP firewall configuration capabilities in addition to the authentication. Where rules are needed to grant access to the database from the originating IP-address of each request. The screenshot in <a href="firewall.JPG">Figure 4.2</a> shows the firewall configuration page on Azure Portal. </p>

        <div><!--Conclusion 5 -->
          <h1 class="text-left" id="conc">5. Conclusion</h1>
          <p>In this report there has been shown the method of conducting stability analysis of a PI controller inside the control system of an air heater. The tuning of the controller is conducted by the Ziegler-Nichols method with its output results displayed. Based on the results, there are potential possibilities for improved tuning with other methods to decrease the oscillation and gain for a quicker stabilization to the reference value.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the MQTT communication protocol has been implemented for transmission of data between the air heater simulation client and an external subscribing client through a HiveMQ broker. The security delivered withing this protocol is also discussed in the security section of the paper. Where the protocol itself has multiple security layers in addition to requiring user authentication under use.</p>
          <p>The data gathered by the external client has further been stored inside Azures cloud-based SQL database. Security measures to combat potential SQL-injection attack have been taken by creating additional server user, properly using datatypes and not hard coding connection strings in the code. IP-firewalls has also been setup on the Azure Portal to fully secure the databases and deny any access other then the approved IP-addresses. This creates secure databases but could potentially be too restrained. An ASP.NET core web application for monitoring the air heater has also been created and published on an Azure web app, where the data stored inside the database has been retrieved through queries for monitoring purposes. The Azure web page displays monitoring functionalities such as tables and charts in addition to illustration of the air heater process unit.</p>
